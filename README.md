# Predction-of-Forest-Fires-Smoke(Start-of-Fire)-and-No-Fire-using-Transfer-Learned-
Presently there is a huge need for us to predict forest fires, to curb them as soon as possible before it wreaks havoc as it has done several times between 2019-2021(and this pattern doesn't seem to end any soon). Keeping this in mind, I built a classifier using Inception V3 model that'd predict the possibility of forest fire or the start of it(smoke). Used the dataset composed of 800 forest fires, smoke and no fire images, I augmented it to make a dataset of 5794 images and then trained and validated through our model. The observed accuracy was 88.85 percent in training and 81.63 percent in validation. Pretty Neat!

Further Improvements: To make the model predict using live video of the event
